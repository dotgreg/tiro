One of the most interesting features that I wanted to implement in Tiro is the idea of having an AI assistant available on mobile and desktop.

The main problem I saw with current solutions was reducing friction between the writing process and the AI assistance at the user experience level.

My first attempt was to integrate a command line manager called Commander, but I quickly realized that the integration of this and the use of command lines for AI was not optimal, so I gave up in using AI bots inside Tiro that way.

My second attempt, which I will describe here, was to get as close as possible to the user experience offered by Microsoft's Copilot or Notion's AI system.

The goal was to reduce the number of steps needed to get an answer:
- Write the question in Tiro Notes
- Select the text of the question
- Immediately obtain an AI-generated response in the note

The objective is also to respect a certain open source philosophy by offering the choice to users to use different AI engines, including open source ones in the future. The solution is designed to be easily interchangeable from the user settings.

On the coding side, it happened to be quite easy to implement it. 
The main logic was :
  - User select a part of the text
  - A small popup appears suggesting AI assistance
  - If clicked, the selected text is sent to Tiro Notes backend that executes a configurable command line with it as a parameter
  - The answer is then sent back to the active note, below the question
  - As for ChatGPT, the answer is not sent once but streamed (almost word by word), I had to create a new api function ```api.command.stream```

The code is visible at that link, I will probably refactor it latest to its own manager file
https://github.com/dotgreg/tiro-notes/blob/4d4a845c15aa53b6e59830f4268445e9f96c09bb/client/src/components/dualView/CodeMirrorEditor.component.tsx#L386/

I am using two api functions: 
  - the newly created  ```api.command.stream(cmd, streamChunk => { })``` to execute the command on Tiro Notes backend
  - api.file.saveContent(p.file.path, nText) to save the note regularly

```js
getApi(api => {
  let cmd = api.userSettings.get("ui_editor_ai_command")
  cmd = cmd.replace("{{input}}", selectionTxt)
  genTextAt(genParams())
  api.command.stream(cmd, streamChunk => {
    if (streamChunk.isError) isError = true
    // if it is an error, display it in a popup
    if (isError) {
      api.ui.notification.emit({
        content: `[AI] Error from CLI <br/> "${cmd}" <br/>=> <br/>${streamChunk.text}`,
        options: {hideAfter: -1 }
      })
      genTextAt({...genParams(), textUpdate:"", isLast: true})
    } else {
      // else insert it
      genTextAt({...genParams(), textUpdate:streamChunk.textTot, isLast: streamChunk.isLast})
    }
  })
})
```
