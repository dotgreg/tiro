I have been quite busy working on Tiro and deploying it to the command line (npx tiro-notes@develop) so I left aside the binaries releases. 
Here is an update. Goal is to increase the binary releases to 1 every 1-2 months.

The changelog is huge as quite a lot has been going on in term of functionalities and bugfix. More than 100 new functionalities have been added.
An emphasis has been done on performance improvement and stability.

I am still struggling to document everything that is being released, so it will be done slowly by slowly on the [https://tiro-notes.org](https://tiro-notes.org)  website and on the blog [https://tiro-notes.org/blog](https://tiro-notes.org/blog)
